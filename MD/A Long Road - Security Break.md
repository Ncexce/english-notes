# A Long Road - Security Break



## Seed of Breaking

   10:00 p.m. , Technology Center.  

> Radio: Caution! Caution! Kernel panic. Kernel panic.  
> Radio: Kernel replacing required.  
> Radio: Kernel file not found. Please replace the kernel file and reboot.  



## Decision I "Working System Replacing"

   The next morning, we wake up shocked. The security border is destructing. This is not a good new. One of the basic fact is that the security system's security border is the basic defense of the technology center. Without it, the technology center will no doubt be attacked by a bunch of useless data.  
   Unfortunately, the department's teacher is not here recently. This means that we need to solve this problem ourself. Checking the system log, we surprisingly found that the system was hit by a malicious command which only would be done by the people "Inside".  
   But we don't have any time to be suspicious of other people. After a while of calculation, we know that the border will halt in 3 months.  
   Emergency meeting was held. And we've been allocated some missions. I has the busiest mission: Rewrite the kernel code in order to rebuild it. I got my permission to bring my personal laptop. Phew. Time for work. First things first, I decided to get my working system replaced.  
   After some trouble, the new system - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS was installed.



## First Construction

### 1. Gedit

   Gedit is the main editor of the desktop environment GNOME.  When I first opened it, I was attracted by its fantastic interface. This is the simplest text editor I have ever used. At this moment, I've decided to use gedit as mt default text editor.

### 2. GCC

   After transformed into linux, I find that in linux, there is no build tools yet, so I can't possibly click a button to build a project. To make matters worse, I don't even have a compiler to compile. Searching the application store and browsing the internet, I found that the compiler in linux is GCC - GNU Compiler Collection. I used the command that the web gave:  

```shell
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

install complete. I think I have the compiler now, although I still don't know how to use it.
