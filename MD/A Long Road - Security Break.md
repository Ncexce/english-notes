## Decision I "Working System Replacing"

   The next morning, we wake up shocked. The `security border` is destructing. This is not a good new. One of the basic fact is that the security system's security border is the basic defense of the technology center. Without it, the technology center will no doubt be attacked by a bunch of useless data.  
   Unfortunately, the department's teacher is not here recently. This means that we need to solve this problem ourself. Checking the system log, we surprisingly found that the system was hit by a malicious command which only would be done by the people "Inside".  
   But we don't have any time to be suspicious of other people. After a while of calculation, we know that the border will halt in 3 months.  
   Emergency meeting was held. And we've been allocated some missions. I has the busiest mission: Rewrite the kernel code in order to rebuild it. I got my permission to bring my personal laptop. Phew. Time for work. First things first, I decided to get my working system replaced.  
   After some trouble the new system - Ubuntu 19.10 was installed.
