Honorable judges:  
Hello! I'm glad to give this speech to you.



###### Opening

   There are many problems disturbing us,including the problem of doing things right or doing the right thing. For example,our English learning. Learning English can be a very complicated thing, and many people thought they are doing everything right.  
   However,things are not so simple like this.



###### Body - Example 1

   To me, doing the right thing is the base of doing things right.  
   Let me give you an example. Early in the Warring State period, when Ji Liang was on his way seeing his master, he saw a man going to the north. Ji Liang asked him were he was going and the man answered that he was going to the country Chu.  *This is very weird*, Ji Liang thought. So he told the man that he had gone the wrong way. The country Chu is at the South.  
   The man said: I have a great horse, a great driver, and I have many money to go. Ji Liang said: Even though you have so many things, you can't arrive because you are going the wrong way!  
   It was obvious that doing the wrong things will make no use even you are doing things right.



###### Body - Example 2

   Doing the wrong things can even harm yourself and your family.  
   I'll give you another example. Computers are made to execute commands and they can execute commands very well. It can nearly do anything you can think.  
   However, viruses can destroy it. I've spent a long time thinking why things like this will happen, and now I know why. The reason is simple but very serious. The computer will also execute the command the viruses give and destroy the computer itself. This is because that the computer executes the command without thinking whether the command is normal or harmful or not.  
   The computer cannot tell whether it is doing the right things,but it can do things very well. We can see that Just doing things right will only play an opposite role.



###### Ending

***

   We can see that only `Doing things right` is not enough. It must require `Doing right things`. So,we should start from doing right things rather than only focus on doing things right.
